Vapechimp,"Very rarely do I feel compelled into leaving a review, however considering the huge  amount of work that Daniel at SEO Plus undertook for us then it is only fair that I do so! 
I thought long and hard about whether to pay extra for the premium version of this SEO app but it turned out to be one of the best business decisions I have made all year and only wish I had done so sooner. 
As soon as I upgraded Daniel contacted me and highlighted a major issue that I had no idea about. I was using the langify app and he explained and advised me clearly what my issues were. Not only did he advise me , he also helped solve the some other SEO problems and continued to make improvements that resulted in a near 100% increase in traffic in just over a week! 
If you're in any doubt about whether the premium version is worth it then just try it!
I cannot recommend these guys highly enough and am genuinely very happy about the decision to pay for the premium version.

AKK Unique Gifts,"I was struggling over 6 months with my new website and I didn't know what is wrong. Daniel did amazing job! First thing - he gives you advice for FREE! In these days it's very hard to find somebody who will give you a free advice. And second - because I am a little ""technically challenged"" and English is my second language so it was very difficult for me to understand. I also know absolutely nothing about SEO because I am an artist without technical abilities. So I needed a real help. For a very reasonable price Daniel fixed my website and made it finally work. He doesn't push you to spend more and more money as the others and his service is more than excellent! I have only superlatives to say about this guy. He is a very good specialist in this field but even better as a person. He communicates with his customers and satisfies every possible request. He is truly trying to help and he does. I can't describe it better than the customer STIBERA 2 reviews below me. I recommend Plug in SEO to everyone who needs some help with SEO.
I was a little prejudiced on beginning because I had a very bad experience with some other companies but I have to admit that this was the best investment that I ever have done.

Once agreed they implemented the changes promptly. We will see if this makes a difference to our online presence in the near future. Would recommend.",5,18-Nov-22,United Kingdom
Lula Grey,"5 stars for the really helpful customer service! This review is based on my experience with their plus plan. Overall, the process for checking for SEO problems is really simple but implementing the suggested changes is sometimes a bit harder. You can pay a separate fee to have someone fix it for you, but I haven't used that service so I can't comment on it. The main reason I'm giving a 5-star rating is that their customer service has been really helpful. I recently changed themes and didn't have the Plug in SEO code installed correctly so I sent an email to support. Libby installed everything and verified that there were no duplicate page titles or meta descriptions, which was especially helpful because it's hard for me to figure that out when there is code from multiple sources (theme code, other apps). Overall I'm happy with this app and think it's worth the cost as someone who has little SEO experience.",5,"Edited September 11, 2019",United States

Pocket Pals Trail Maps,We installed the Plug in SEO Plus app.  We were hoping to get an increase in traffic to our store. We tried this app out because while our traffic had been good at one time it had dropped off and we were trying to get it back. After 5 months and lots of effort between us and the tech support people we were still unable to improve our traffic so we discontinued the app.  The tech support team is small and for the most part they were really attentive to most of our questions but on occaision they would either ignore us or string us along on some issues that we would never get an answer to.,3,23-Jan-20,United States

Now my website is quite busy and has been around for many years, but when I changed Platforms to Shopify I pretty much had to start from scratch and build up my SEO, which is obviously not perfect as I only starting doing this 3 months ago.  Now we all know (or should know) that onsite SEO can take years to build, but apparently mine is perfect all the time.  I do get about 30K+ visitors a month but I reckon my SEO could be better, but with this app telling it's perfect I don't know where I can improve things which is the whole point of the app in the first place.",3,30-Mar-17,United Kingdom

WORLDTIMER,"We purchased the ""Premium SEO Package"" on Feb 19, 2022. Our website has over 100 products. We understood that in this package they will only do 10 products and that's fine. But even so in these 10 products they did not do Product Meta Title, Product SEO descriptions and Alt Image Text. Then they gave us 10 suggestions for Product H2 Subheadings and they had used a few of them for the 10 products they did. Since we have over 100 products, we then asked them to give us a few more suggestions. Today is March 14 and they have not replied us at all until now. So we suggest not to buy any additional package from this company. Maybe you hire an expert to help you is cheaper and we are sure ""BETTER""!!",1,"Edited March 13, 2022",Hong Kong SAR

7TEA®,"Neues Feedback: Die Reaktion vom Support ist schnell und vielleicht wird das Problem gelöst, wenn gelöst, gibt es 5 Sterne. Support und Service müssen belohnt werden. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Die App ist eher schädlich für dein SEO.
Gründe: - Die schreibt alles um, was man mühevoll erarbeitet hat.
- Es wurden 58 Seiten nicht mehr von Google indiziert und aus der Suche geworfen. - Das Tool kommt mit dem ""Ö"",""Ä"" und ""Ü"" nicht zurecht und ersetzt diese durch sehr komische Zeichen.
- Keine wirkliche Kontrolle in der App
- Statistik sagt das was nicht stimmt, aber nicht was man machen soll
Leider ist diese App für diesen Preis, keine gute Wahl. Ich habe im Bereich WordPress schon viele SEO Apps verwendet, auf Shopify ist es wirklich schlimm. p.s. nach der Deinstallation ist die App weiterhin aktiv und muss mühevoll aus dem Code gelöscht werden. Wie kann das sein?",4,"Edited January 2, 2022",Germany

Cayce Golf,"We've had this app for a month, nothing but issues. Shopify recommended this app after our previous SEO app was banned from the app store. The main functions we needed were passing along Structured Data to google, we're a month in and *maybe* have that figured out now. We also noticed that once the app was installed folks started finding old, deleted products on google and bringing them to 404 pages. We NEVER had 404 issues, now we have had thousands in a fw short weeks. The biggest issue was their support email rejects all emails--their listed support email help@pluginseo.com rejects any emails. The email help@pluginuseful.com must be used which is not listed here, but they will respond back from help@pluginseo.com and you will not be able to have a conversation/thread with them. The only way I was able to open a thread of communication with them was by asking Shopify Support to start an email chain. But not even Shopify will give me their true contact email. Honestly surprised they are allowed to have an App without a help email. I have no idea how this app has 5 stars. I am also adding here that it's called Plug in SEO in the app store, but when you download the app the title is Plus in SEO ""BETA"" which would make sense why it's not working perfectly.",1,"Edited September 21, 2022",United States

They tell me my blog post isn't part of my domain when it is, and that my last three posts don't have any internal links to my website (products and other blog posts) when they do.

We considered employing someone to do this for us and now I feel that with the the help of the app, I will learn how to do this myself and will be able to roll out the lessons i've learned on other websites, so we have in fact saved 10's of thousands using the app. Thank you PlugInSEO",5,23-Feb-22,United Kingdom

I understand that you blame shopify for limiting what you can do, but maybe you should be more upfront about it. I don't think many people would pay for this if they knew that all the problems wouldn't be resolved. Telling me that the remaining issues are insignificant just doesn't wash... What you're telling me is that I could have come to you with a perfectly optimized website (so much as Shopify allows) and your analyzer would still recommend the paid service. The only function of the speed analyzer is lining up business. The checklist of tasks performed is so incredibly vague that I doubt it varies at all between clients.",3,23-Jan-16,United States

Doppeltree,"*Update* For some reason, later responses were routed to our spam email folder. I see that Plug in SEO did respond to me. Will revise review again after working with Plug in SEO to fix issues* We ran into an issue after installing the app on 2/11. Discovered that I was missing all of our page titles and meta descriptions even though they were all showing up correctly within Shopify. I immediately uninstalled the app to try and revert my store back to the original state. To Plug in SEO's credit, they did reach out to me immediately after my uninstall and offered to help me troubleshoot. Happy to get their help, I reinstalled the app and waited for their response. But after a day of not hearing back, I decided I couldn't wait any longer (since my page titles and meta descriptions were all still missing), so I uninstalled the app a second time and reverted everything back to it's original state. Granted, it could've been a minor issue that was easily fixable, but the lack of follow up communication after the initial message on 2/11 through today 2/16 was/is not a positive customer experience.",4,"Edited February 16, 2021",United States

ExcellentSupply.com,"This app did not prove to be super helpful for us. Every SEO issue that the app flagged led us to a dead end - with an invitation to PAY their ""expert"" to help fix it for us. This app doesn't seem to provide a clear and intuitive way to resolve SEO issues on your own. I want an SEO app that delivers spot-on search results, without digging into my wallet for extended add-on services. There are better SEO apps out there IMHO. We're switching our store over to the Sherpas Smart SEO app which makes it simple for end-users to tweak SEO on their own. --- But do your own research to confirm... Read the Shopify reviews for any SEO app you see in the app store; then visit the store that posted the review, copy a line of their data, and do a Google search. It's pretty easy to establish whether an SEO app delivers on its promises. Not saying Plugin SEO is bad, I just feel there are better options and more user-friendly tools out there.",1,"Edited May 13, 2021",United States
